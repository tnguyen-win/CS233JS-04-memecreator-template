/*  
Create a class called Memes
- Part 1 - Setup the canvas and draw the default meme
  - Initialize instance variables for all of the ui elements in the constructor
      this.$bottomTextInput = 
      this.$imageInput = 
      this.$downloadButton = 
      this.$canvas = 
      this.$defaultImage = document.querySelector('#defaultImage');
      this.image = this.$defaultImage
      this.$context = this.$canvas.getContext('2d');
      this.deviceWidth = window.innerWidth;

  - Write the method createCanvas
    - set the width of the canvas to the minimum of 1000 and deviceWidth - 30
    - set the height of the canvas to the min of 1000 and the deviceWidth
    - add a call to this method in the constructor

  - Write the method createMeme.  It should
    - clear the previous image from the page
    - draw the image
      - initialize the height and width of the canvas to the height and width of the (default) image
      - draw the image on the context
    - setup text drawing
      - initialize a local constant for the font size.  Here's the calculation   
        this.$canvas.width+this.$canvas.height)/2)*4/100;
      - set the font of the context to `${fontSize}pt sans-serif`
        Notice the template literal instead of concatenation!
      - set the textAlign property to center
      - set the textBaseline property to top
      - set the lineWidth property to 1/5 of the fontSize
      - set the strokeStyle (outline) property to black
      - set the fillStyle to white
    - draw the text
      - get the default bottom text from the ui and put it in a variable
      - make sure it is all caps
      - write it on the context 
      - don't forget to outline the text in black!
    - add a call to this method in the constructor
  END OF PART 1 - TEST AND DEBUG YOUR CODE - YOU SHOULD SEE THE MEME ON THE PAGE

- PART 2 - Change the code as the user types
  - Write the method addEventListeners
    - bind this to the class for the method createMeme
    - add the keyup event and the change event to the bottom text input element
  - Add a call to this method in the constructor
  END OF PART 2 - TEST AND DEBUG YOUR CODE - YOU SHOULD SEE THE MEME CHANGE WHEN YOU TYPE

- PART 3 - Download the meme
  - Write the method downloadMeme
    - declare a constant imageSource and set it to the canvas converted to data
    - set the href attribute of the download button to the imageSource
  - Change the addEventListers method to include downloading
    - bind the class to the downloadMeme method
    - add an event handler to the click event for the download button
END OF PART 3 - TEST AND DEBUG YOUR CODE - YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE MEME

- PART 4 - Choose an image
  - Write the method loadImage
    - if there's something in the file input on the page
      - declare and instantiate a FileReader object
      - set it's onload hander to an anonymous function that
        - set the image instance variable to a new image
        - set it's onload handler to an anonymou function that
          - calls the createMeme method
        - set the src property of the image to the result from reading the file
      - read the file
  - Change the addEventListeners
    - bind the class to the loadImage method
    - add an event handler to the change event for the file input element on the page
END OF PART 4 - TEST AND DEBUG YOUR CODE - YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PICK AN IMAGE FOR THE MEME

- Part 5 - Resize the image if the user picks a really big image
  - Write the method resizeImage
    resizeCanvas(canvasHeight, canvasWidth) {
      let height = canvasHeight;
      let width = canvasWidth;
      let scale = 1;
      while(height > Math.min(1000, this.deviceWidth-30) && width > Math.min(1000, this.deviceWidth-30)) {
        height /= 2;
        width /= 2;
        scale /= 2
      }
      this.$canvas.height = height;
      this.$canvas.width = width;
      this.$context.scale(scale, scale);
    }
  - Change the method addEventListener
    - bind the class to the resizeImage method
    - call resizeCanvas in createMeme just before you draw the image
END OF PART 5 - TEST AND DEBUG YOUR CODE - YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PICK A REALLY LARGE IMAGE

- Part 6 - Provide the user with some additional functionality.  You could
  - allow the user to add text to the top of the meme
  - allow the user to pick the font for the text
  - allow the user to pick the font color for the text
  - allow the user to pick the font size for the text
  - FOR at least 2 of the additional features 
    - add html element to the html page to allow the user to work with your feature
    - change the JS class to add event handlers to your ui elements.  The event should trigger a call to createMeme
    - change the createMeme method to add your features to the canvas.
